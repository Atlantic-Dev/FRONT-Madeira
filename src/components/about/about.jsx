        <p className="aboutText"> Madeira is a card game set in the middle ages. Each user builds its own deck and plays a game to beat the opponent. The first to run out of life points loses, and the winner gets a chest to unlock more cards. If the game is ranked, the winner adds 15 points and the loser subtracts 15 points from his accumulated total, which determines his ranking and status. </p>
